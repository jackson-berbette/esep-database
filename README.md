## Reflection
This was one of my favorite assignments. The expectations were clear and the given resources were helpful while still allowing me to do some of my own work and research. To make this assignment more "official", I think including some sort of test suite would be a good idea. Then one of the deliverables could be a screenshot of our code passing all tests. This just reduces hassle and confusion in installing and running each student's code.
